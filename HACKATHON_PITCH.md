A: We inject age-specific guidelines into Claude's system prompt - simple words for toddlers, sophisticated vocabulary for teens.

**Q: How do you filter out chain stores?**
A: We maintain a comprehensive exclusion list of 40+ major chains and only show results with 'cafe/park' categories that pass our filter.

**Q: What if AWS services fail?**
A: We have fallbacks everywhere - Google Places if Location fails, OpenAI if Bedrock fails, demo data if everything fails.

**Q: How scalable is this?**
